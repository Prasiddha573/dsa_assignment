# Program 6: Min Heap and Max Heap Construction

## Data Structure Used
An array is used to represent both min heap and max heap.

## Functions Implemented
swap() exchanges two values.  
minHeapify() maintains the min heap property.  
maxHeapify() maintains the max heap property.

## Organization of main()
The main function reads unsorted array elements.  
It builds a min heap using heapify.  
It builds a max heap using heapify.  
Both heaps are printed.

## Sample Output

Input:
6
4 10 3 5 1 2

Output:
1 4 2 5 10 3
10 5 3 4 1 2
